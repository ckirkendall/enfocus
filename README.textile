h1. Enfocus

Enfocus is a @DOM@ manipulation and templating library for ClojureScript. Inspired by Christophe Grand's "Enlive":http://github/cgrand/enlive, Enfocus' primary purpose is providing a base for building rich interfaces in ClojureScript.

If you are unfamiliar with enlive it is suggested you take a look at the following tutorials before diving into Enfocus.

David Nolen wrote a "nice tutorial":http://github.com/swannodette/enlive-tutorial/

h2. Actions, templates and snippets

A snippet is a function that returns a seq of nodes, it can be used as a
building block for more complex templates or actions.  

You define a snippet by providing a remote resource, a selector and series of transformations.  
The snippet definition below selects a table body from the remote resource 
templates/template1.html and grabs the first row.  It then fills the content of the row.

<pre>
  (em/defsnippet snippet2 "templates/template1.html" ["tbody > *:first-child"] 
               [fruit quantity] 
               ["tr > *:first-child"] (em/content fruit)
               ["tr > *:last-child"] (em/content (str quantity)))
</pre>


A template is very similar to a snippit except it does not require a selector to 
grap a sub section, instead the entire remote resource is used as the dom. 
If the remote resource is a full html document only what is inside the body tag is
brought into the template.

<pre>
  (em/deftemplate template2 "/templates/template1.html" [fruit-data] 
                ["#heading1"] (em/content "fruit")  
                ["thead tr > *:last-child"] (em/content "quantity")
                ["tbody"] (em/content
                           (map #(snippit2 % (fruit-data %)) (keys fruit-data))))
</pre>

An action is a set of transforms that take place on the live dom.  below is a 
definition of a an action.

<pre>
(em/defaction action2 [] 
             [".cool[foo=false]"] (em/content (template2 {"bannan" 5 "pineapple" 10}))
             ["#heading1"] (em/set-attr :id "new-heading1"))
</pre>


h2. The @at@ form

The @at@ form is a very important form in Enfocus and in Enlive. There are implicit @at@ 
forms in @action@, @snippet@ and @template@.  

<pre>
  (at a-node
    [:a :selector] a-transformation
    [:another :selector] another-transformation
    ...)
</pre>


Transformations are closures which take one arg (the selected node) and return
nil, another node or an arbitrarily nested collection of nodes.

Rules are applied top-down: the first rule transforms the whole tree and the
resulting tree is passed to the next rules.


h2. Transformations

A transformation is a function that returns either a node or collection of node.

h3. Enfocus defines several helper functions:

Supported Enlive Transformations 
<pre>
  content            (content "xyz" a-node "abc")             
  html-content       (html-content "<blink>please no</blink>")
  set-attr           (set-attr :attr1 "val1" :attr2 "val2")
  remove-attr        (remove-attr :attr1 :attr2) 
  add-class          (add-class "foo" "bar")
  remove-class       (remove-class "foo" "bar")
  do->               (do-> transformation1 transformation2) 
  append             (append "xyz" a-node "abc")
  prepend            (prepend "xyz" a-node "abc")
  after              (after "xyz" a-node "abc")
  before             (before "xyz" a-node "abc")
  substitute         (substitute "xyz" a-node "abc")
</pre>

New Transformations
<pre>
  set-style	     (set-style :font-size "10px" :background "#fff")
  remove-style	     (remove-style :font-size :background)
  add-event	     (add-event :mouseover (fn [event] ...))
  remove-event	     (remove-event :mouseover :mouseout)
  fade-in	     (fade-in time step-size)
  fade-out           (fade-out time step-size)
  resize	     (resize width height ttime step-size)
  move		     (move x y ttime step-size)
</pre>

Currently there are several transformation that are supported by Enlive but not Enfocus. (Patches very welcome!!)
<pre>
  wrap               (wrap :div) or (wrap :div {:class "foo"}) 
  unwrap             unwrap
  clone-for          (clone-for [item items] transformation)
                     or (clone-for [item items] 
                          selector1 transformation1
                          selector2 transformation2)
  move               (move [:.footnote] [:#footnotes] content)
</pre>
